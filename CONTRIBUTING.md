## Contributor Guidelines

A contributor is an individual or entity that actively participates in the development of a software project by making code contributions, submitting bug reports, proposing new features, offering suggestions for improvements, or engaging in discussions related to the project's development.

Contributors can come from diverse backgrounds and skill levels. They may contribute in various ways, such as:

- **Code Contributions**: Writing, reviewing, and submitting code changes to add new features, fix bugs, or improve existing functionality.

- **Bug Reports**: Identifying and reporting issues, bugs, or unexpected behavior encountered while using the software.

- **Feature Requests**: Suggesting new features, enhancements, or improvements to the project.

- **Documentation**: Writing, updating, or improving documentation to help users understand how to use the software or contribute to the project.

- **Testing**: Conducting testing and quality assurance activities to ensure the software functions correctly and meets its requirements.

- **Community Engagement**: Participating in discussions, providing feedback, and helping other users or contributors within the project's community forums, mailing lists, or chat channels.
